## Day 1 Homework feedback from Kate Weaver

* I saw both files that I was looking for (script & output), but I didn't see the fifth question. Estimated reasonable completion: 4/5 or 80%
* I really like your comments (especially and example line of the SAM file!), informative variable names, and the descriptive print statements!
  * relatedly, I would recommend different variable names in lines 31 and 33, but what you have works! It takes care of the int conversions, and that's very important
