## Day 1 homework -- 5 pts possible. 5/5

1. number of alignments script + output --> +1
2. perfect match alignments script + output --> +1
3. average MAPQ script + output --> +1
4. alignment on 2L between 10K and 20K script + output --> +1
5. PCR duplicates script + output --> +0

* Note: half point for not including a bit of the script or the output for each subpart

## Day 2 lunch -- 4 pts possible. 4/4

1. python script which accepts and uses optional 3rd argument (2 pts)
2. output for mapping with 2 arguments only
3. output for mapping with 3 arguments

(Giving 100% completion on this since the feedback from Mike says 100% even though the output files aren't there.)

* Note: output points are only for presence/absence. correctness points for script

## Day 2 homework -- 4 pts possible. 4/4

1. python script (2 pts) --> +2
2. fasta parser (either as separate file or within python script) --> +1
3. first 1000 lines of the script output (1/4 of a point if not 1K) --> +1

* Note: output points are only for presence/absence. correctness points for script

## Day 3 lunch -- 4 points possible. 3/4

1. python script --> +1
2. reported protein coding gene (tin or pre-mod(mdg4)-N) --> +1
3. reported distance (27 or 5375) --> +0
4. reported iterations --> +1

* Note: output points are only for presence/absence. correctness points for script

## Day 4 lunch -- 4 points possible. 2/4
