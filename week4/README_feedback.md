4.5/5 
- Can you re-do the first histogram? It's not clear what you're showing, because the x axis labels are shuffled (-0.5) 
- Think about your axes (for all plots) and bin numbers (for the histograms) - would increasing/lengthening them in either direction make the difference between E4 and E5 more obvious?
