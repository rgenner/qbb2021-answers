You've got a great start here! Dendrogram and heatmap both look great and you're set up well to run the regression. I look forward to seeing the qqplots, volcano plots, and FDR-significant genes. (-4.5)

UPDATE 12-13-21: Nice work! For the qqplot, just make sure you include the line for the "expected distribution" (i.e. just a y=x line). It's difficult to visually compare your results to the null hypothesis without that line (-0.2). Also, we asked for a qqplot for the regression without sex as a covariate as well (-0.5)

6.3/7
