First bit looks good! Minor comments on the heatmap, You should be able to make it square, and then you'll want to set the xlimits on the eigenvector plot so that they stretch to the edge of the plot. I'm missing the bed file, the commands you used (bedtools map), the gene expression heatmap, and the final violin plot (-3)
