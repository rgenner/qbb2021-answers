This looks really great! The alignments are good, the only thing I'm missing is the alignment info (alignment score and number of gaps) for both alignments (-1)

4/5

Revisions: Updated python script to include alignment score and number of gaps
Updated alignment txt files in case anything changed

UPDATE 12-14-21

Great work! The code looks fine, but actually seeing the output re: number of gaps and alignment score would have been helpful (0.25)

4.75/5
